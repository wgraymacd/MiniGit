This program was created to simulate the common C++ git program. Users are able to create minigit
directories, add files, remove files, commit changes and checkout to previous file versions
similar to how git and github work. A special feature that is included is the ability to take a look
at the current "status" of the current commit. Status not only displays the current commit number, 
but also the SLL or current added/removed files.
